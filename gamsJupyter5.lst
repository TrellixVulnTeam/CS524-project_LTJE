 ** Warning **  The value of LFITER is out of range.
                LFITER is decreased from 2147483647 to 1000000000.
 
 ** Warning **  The variance of the derivatives in the initial
                point is large (= 4.2 ). A better initial
                point, a better scaling, or better bounds on the
                variables will probably help the optimization.
