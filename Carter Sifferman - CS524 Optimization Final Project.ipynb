While we could jump straight into using real-world data from a real robot arm with a sensor attached, using simulated data will let us test our model under \"ideal\" conditions with no noise. After we confirm that our model works under ideal conditions, we can test it out on real data (see section [Evaluation](#evaluation) below).\n",

    "## Note: Alternating Least Squares (QCP) Optimization Model\n",

    "The bilinear case of our model has something special about it: if you hold any one set of unknowns (either the plane parameters or sensor parameters) constant, it becomes a least squares problem - either the [unknown plane version](#lstsq_plane) or [unknown sensor version](#lstsq_sensor) described above. We could exploit this, and alternate between the two least squares problems, using the solution from one model to fix the parameters in the next. This way, we would never have to touch NLP! (Although, in a way, we would still be doing NLP, just more manually, using two QCPs, I think)\n",
    "\n",
    "At least, in theory. I messed around this for a while and never got it working. I haven't found great resources for this online - most are talking about the matrix factorization problem, which may be equivalent, but reading about it doesn't help. I think the problem is that our problems aren't plain least squares because of the unit vector constraints, so they're not gauranteed to converge when you alternate.\n",
    "\n",
    "I've removed my work since this document is already long and there are more interesting things to focus on. Plus, [the NLP model above](#bilinear) seems to be pretty robust, and fast enough, since we're never going to be solving problems with more than ~50 terms, and speed is not crucial."
